For detailed instructions on how this software works, how to configure it and use it, go to https://cruisin.co

This software was initially developed for the Arduino IDE to convert a mobility scooter into an electric car for my children, examples of which can be seen at https://cruisin.co. Since it's initial development it has become much more complex and can now support many different configuration options, vechile types etc.

The software has been written to run on a number of different types of Arduino IDE compatible hardware (as development progressed) but the main hardware that I use and test on is the Maple Mini. If you choose to use a different piece of hardware than the Maple Mini, please note that I have not tested the software on anything hardware other than the Maple Mini for quite some time.

At this point in time, I think the software has gotten too large and complex for the Arduino Pro Mini to run it.
